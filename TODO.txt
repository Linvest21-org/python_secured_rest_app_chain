This project requires you to demostrate secured RESTful communications for FastAPI based python web application. 

You will need create at least two FastAPI applications:
* Each application needs to support both HTTP and HTTPS. For development environment, the applicaiton should be able to handle not-signed certificates. 
* Build a trusted connection between above two FastAPI application. For example, app1 and app2, use PKI cert to ensure app2 only accepts HTTP/HTTPS requests from app1, and rejects any calls from other clients. 

A successful delivery should include:
* Full working code base
* Unit Tests
* Readme.md
